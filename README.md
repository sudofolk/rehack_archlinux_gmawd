a lot of this is shit too, it is a reverse engineering project that i've been working on for a little while i guess water the implications. Linux gmod cheat chromium x86_64, this has a lot of dynamic techniques
i'll start working on it again when i have the ability to dual boot windows and linux.. need a 1TB SSD.

* start writing like a C coder and reuse every variable that i can
